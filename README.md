# YEScoder

YEScoder is a repository for Young Empowered Scientists at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute


Our work with this package will emphasize the use
of programming with R in several domains

- working with images as digital files that are
manipulated and displayed for human visualization

- working with maps that provide location information
on cancer incidence

- working with public information on cancer genomics
and genetics

Visit the "Get started" tab, follow instructions, and get coding!
