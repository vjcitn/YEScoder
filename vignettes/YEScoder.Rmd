# YEScoder and cancer data science

Our work with this package will emphasize the use
of programming with R in several domains

- working with images as digital files that are
manipulated and displayed for human visualization

- working with maps that provide location information
on cancer incidence

- working with public information on cancer genomics
and genetics

# Getting started with YEScoder images

You'll be working with RStudio to manage your code
and data.  Once you have started RStudio, you can
issue these commands in the console:

```
install.packages("BiocManager") # respond affirmatively to any prompts
BiocManager::install("vjcitn/littleDeep") # affirmative to any prompts
BiocManager::install(c("vjcitn/YEScoder", "BiocStyle"))
```

Once these have succeeded, visit the [ImageArray](https://vjcitn.github.io/YEScoder/articles/Z1_ImageArrays.html) introduction for some basic activities with
images.
